## OxyParser JS
Parser links to files from OxyCloud

> By default, the sorting of received links by file type is enabled. In order for the links to be in the same file, you need to run main.js with the "--unsort" argument
Example: node main.js --unsort

Logs are saved in the current directory from where the file was launched

## Run
To run the script, you will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) at least version 16.9.0, as well as the dependencies that the script uses to install them in the root folder of the project, open the console and write `npm i` after which the dependencies should be installed.
